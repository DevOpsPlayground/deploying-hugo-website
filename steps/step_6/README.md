# Let's look at Hugo

## What is Hugo?
Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, easy use, and flexibility. 
Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

While Hugo is a great tool for creating static websites, it is not the only one. Other popular static site 
generators include Jekyll, Gatsby, and Next.js.

# Installing Hugo
For this workshop, we've pre-installed Hugo to save some time - however installation is straightforward.
If you need to install this yourself, you can find instructions on the [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/installation/).
